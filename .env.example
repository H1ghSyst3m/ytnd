# YTND-BOT Environment Variables
#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your details.
# Do NOT commit the .env file to your repository.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Core Bot Configuration (Required) ---
# Your Telegram bot token from @BotFather
BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11
# The Telegram User ID of the default administrator.
# You can get this from bots like @userinfobot
DEFAULT_ADMIN_ID=123456789

# --- Syncthing Integration (Required for file syncing) ---
# The API key for your Syncthing instance. Find it in the web UI under Actions -> Settings -> API Keys.
SYNCTHING_API_KEY=YourSyncthingApiKeyHere
# The URL of your Syncthing instance's web UI. Default is http://127.0.0.1:8384
SYNCTHING_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8384

# --- Manager Server Configuration (Important for the Web UI) ---
# The public-facing base URL of the manager server.
# This is crucial for generating correct one-time login links.
# If running on a server at IP 1.2.3.4 on port 8080, it would be http://1.2.3.4:8080
# If running over domain with HTTPS, it would be https://yourdomain.com
MANAGER_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
# The IP address the manager server should listen on. 0.0.0.0 makes it accessible on your local network.
MANAGER_HOST=0.0.0.0
# The port the manager server should listen on.
MANAGER_PORT=8080

# --- Advanced Configuration (Optional) ---
# A strong, unique secret for signing session cookies. If not set, it defaults to your BOT_TOKEN,
# but it's more secure to use a separate secret.
# You can generate one with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
MANAGER_SECRET=
# Set to "true" for production deployments over HTTPS to enable secure cookies.
# Defaults to "false".
MANAGER_PRODUCTION=false
# Set to "0" to disable structured (JSON) logging in the console and use plain text instead.
# Defaults to "1" (enabled).
YTND_LOG_JSON=1
